## What is Unity Background Service?
Unity Background Service is a project that shows how to create an Android service for Unity application working on background. 
Usually Android service (especially in Unity apps) shuts down when we kill the app. It is impossible to make the service working fully in background. The only solution is to let the
service work on foreground as a notification and then the users are able to hide that notification if they wants to.
Specifically, this project shows the creation of a step counting service that works on background.
